## What is Version Control ‚ÅâÔ∏è  
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It is essential for collaboration and maintaining code history.  

## Git vs GitHub  
- **Git**: Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project's development.  
- **GitHub**:  GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a repository hosting service for Git projects. It allows you to host, manage, and share your code with others, as well as collaborate on projects.  

## 3 GitHub Alternatives  
1. SourceForge.
2. Bitbucket.
3. GitLab.

## Git Fetch vs Git Pull  
- **git fetch**: git fetch retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.  
- **git pull**: Fetches and automatically merges the remote changes into your current branch.  

## Git Rebase  
Rebasing integrates changes from one branch into another by moving commits to the tip of the branch.  
```bash
git rebase <branch>
git rebase main

## Git cherry-pick
 Allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.
 git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
